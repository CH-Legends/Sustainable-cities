            Natural resources are truly man's best friend. They are the materials that support the basic needs of us <span><i>Homo Sapiens</i></span>.
            These important resources include air, sunlight, water, soil, stone, plants, animals and fossil fuels. Let us see the current state of these resources.

            <ul>
                <li> Air - Polluted by factories around the world. Also polluted by emmissions created by vehicles.</li>
                <li> Sunlight - Abundant and untouched as us humans are not capable of, in any way, altering it.</li>
                <li> Water - Often polluted by factories set up near river banks (their waste is dumped into the river). Their is so much human garbage in the ocean that there are massive garbage patches in them.</li>
                <li> Soil - Industrial pollution has caused the soil of some areas to be extremely toxic, making it dangerous to eat any vegetable grown in it.</li>
                <li> Stone - Sulphur and nitrogen oxides, harmful pollutents, mainly produced by factories, react with the moisture in the air to create acids. Acids that are capable of eroding and compromising the structural integrity of stone made monuuments and structures.</li>
                <li> Plants - 571 plant species went extinct due to human activities.</li>
                <li> Animals and fossil fuels - Deforestation has caused many animals to loose their natural habitats which has bean their habitat for generations. Fossil fuels are getting depleted rapidly and just using them as fuels causes a lot of pollution.</li>

            <p>The Worldâ€™s First Carbon-Neutral City: Masdar City in the United Arab Emirates is designed to be the world's first carbon-neutral, zero-waste city, relying entirely on renewable energy. It uses solar power and advanced architectural designs to minimize energy consumption and maximize efficiency.</p>

            The natural resources scarcity problem can easily be solved using sustainable technology.
            <ul>
                <li> Efficient use of energy - Since products created using sustainable technology are much more efficient in their energy consumption, they use much less energy and do their work better at the same time! Since these products use less energy, they 
                     lessen the demand for natural resources used for energy production.</li>
                <li> Renewable energy - Technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines and hydroelectric dams help harness energy from renewable resources, making us less dependent on non renewable resources that cause pollution.</li>
